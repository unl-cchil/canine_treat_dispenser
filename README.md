# Computer-controlled dog treat dispenser

**This project retrofits an existing off-the-shelf dog treat dispenser with new electronics that allow it to be controlled by a computer.**

### Overview

When performing canine operant conditioning studies, the delivery of the reward can be a limiting factor of the study.  While there are a few commercially available options for delivering rewards, they generally require manual input, such as using a remote, to comply with the design of the experiment.  This means that human reaction times and transmission distances can cause interruptions to the flow of the experiment as well as possible data synchronization issues.  The potential for development of non-supervised conditioning studies is limited by this same factor.  To remedy this, we retrofitted an existing off-the-shelf treat dispenser with new electronics that allow it to be remotely controllable as well as act as an experiment computation, data storage, and networking center.  We present two versions of the control circuitry, one that is fully DIY, using an Arduino and other off-the-shelf electronics, and another that is a fully integrated, single-board solution using a Raspberry Pi.   With rather simple modifications, the commercial treat dispenser can be modified into a computer-controlled dispenser for canine cognition experiments or for other forms of canine training or games.
